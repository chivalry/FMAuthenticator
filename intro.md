FMAuthenticator is a technique for implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) in the FileMaker database platform.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Two-factor Authentication?</span>  
 Two-factor authentication requires users to provide two forms of identification before being granted access to a system. The two forms of identification are often described as being "something the user knows" (their username and password) and "something the user has" (such as their cell phone).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How does FMAuthenticator work?</span>  
 1\. A user logs into a FileMaker database as they normally would (by providing their account name and password).  
 2\. FileMaker generates a random security code, and sends it as a text message to the user's mobile device.  
 3\. FileMaker asks the user to enter the code.  
 4\. If the code is entered correctly, then the user is allowed to access the database.  

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Seamless. Native. Easy.</span>  
 FMAuthenticator works seamlessly with the FileMaker platform. It works with both local and hosted databases, and supports FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Go, and WebDirect users. It uses only native FileMaker functionality, so there is no need for plugins. Setup is easy, requiring only one table, one script, and one layout. (For detailed instructions on how to setup and configure FMAuthenticator, [click here](/application/setup.php).)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open source. As in free.</span>  
 FMAuthenticator is provided via an open source license, so it is free to use in your FileMaker-based solutions.
